If you've never been lightly choked in the back seat of a modern somewhat hideous BMW, have you ever truly been loved?</p><p style="color:#000">You're not supposed to see this.</p><p>I couldn't breathe. The car, with its haunched fenders and UPS cardboard shipping box physique and squished face, was pressed against the rocks and mountain ridge. Light steps of leaves tapped on the carbon roof, the leather steering wheel loose, passenger front tire resting on broken pavement and forest air. I folded the mirrors and contorted my body, clenching tightly my ass as if to yield a few extra millimeters of space for the passing car.</p><p>Inches from the door, they made safely their way and disappeared into the mountains behind me with little drama.</p><p>Quickly, I sang a hymn of praise for all the beautiful asian women scattered around the globe, put the car in first, and exhaled. Up until that point, the drive through Big Sur's Los Padres National Forest and mountain path was beautiful. Sunlight danced across the pollenated air and broke through the canopy of trees leaning onto the sky bue M2, goading it deeper into the dark green woods. Throuh the open window, I valved the exhaust and enjoyed the whisper of swaying leaves and happy birds. I played no music, had no thoughts, and all that came to mind was the sweet and soft wind.</p><p>As I broke through the last layer of trees and entered the fierceness of the noon-sun, I let the car loose on the first straight road seen in an hour. The G87 M2, again, gave me all the power I asked but never yielded its comfort, its inherit safety.</p></div></div><script src="main.js"></script></body></html>
