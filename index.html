If you've never been lightly choked in the backseat of a modern, somewhat hideous, BMW, have you ever truly been loved?</p><p><br></p><p class="no-indent"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Tdj1Dx2n/M2-KURO-3.jpg" alt=""></p><br><p>I couldn't breathe.</p><p>The car, with its haunched fenders and UPS cardboard shipping box physique and squished face, was pressed against the rocks and mountain ridge. Light steps of leaves tapped on the carbon roof, the leather steering wheel loose, passenger front tire resting on broken pavement and forest air. I folded the mirrors and contorted my body, clenching tightly my ass as if to yield a few extra millimeters of space for the passing car.</p><p>Inches from the door, they made safely their way and disappeared into the mountains behind me with little drama.</p><p>Quickly, I sang a hymn of praise for all the beautiful asian women scattered around the globe, put the car in first, and exhaled. Up until that point, the drive through Big Sur's Los Padres National Forest and mountain path was beautiful. Sunlight danced across the pollenated air and broke through the canopy of leaves leaning onto the sky blue M2 goading it deeper into the dark green woods. Through the open window, I valved the exhaust and enjoyed the whisper of swaying leaves and happy birds. I played no music, had no thoughts, and all that came to mind was the sweet and soft wind.</p><p>As I broke through the first layer of trees and entered the fierceness of the noon-sun, I let the car loose on the first straight road seen in an hour. The G87 M2, again, gave me all the power I asked but never yielded its comfort, its inherit safety.</p><p>I forgot about my life, my happinesses, my sadnesses, and lived in the simple present moment of a man and his car and the road.</p><br><p>"It's kind of ugly," she said, her hand in my back pocket. "But it I like it. Reminds me of you."</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>Short. Well built. Wide. Like your shoulders."</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>"Ugly."</p><br><p>The car, two days ago, greeted me with softness. The feel of the clutch so light, each noise and click and chime of the interior inviting, the leather of the wheel so ample and immediately called to mind the back of a woman's thigh.</p><p>I felt welcome, I felt anxious.</p><p>The car excitedly came to life, the cold engine strumming, a beautiful woman sent me pictures of her collarbone, and I set off into the sexy afternoon wilderness. The experience so comfortable and immediate, in fact, not ten minutes after taking the keys, I felt at ease taking thirst-traps for my discord-kitten heading south-bound on the four-oh-five cruising at eighty-eight-miles-per-hour in sixth-gear.</p><p>But as much as I liked the light pastel paint and carbon roof that glowed gold in the sun, the large and sharp single screen that so easily bleeds into periphery, the leather of the gear shift, the simple design of the interior, the compact and complete silence of the cabin, the trunk space large enough to fit a big metal suitcase and small box of gifts, and though I was smiling in thirst-traps, I felt as if I couldn't truly immerse myself in the experience. Strange, I thought to myself, just how forgiving it is - you have to struggle to stall the car. So long as there is some minor input of gas, the M2 will give you an extra nudge. Before any hint of a slide, power is immediately corrected. Even the raucous bauble of the engine's exhaust reminiscent of a woman's laugh knowing she is accepted, admired, allowed to simply exist. A niceness and levity, often exploited in humans, at the pilot's command. Comfort and ease, simplicity and safety, an over reliance on electronic assistance and their efficiency in the modern era of cars means having an artificial, superficial, hollow experience. The six-cylinder-sonnet mistranslated through Harmon Kardon speakers; though the leather real, the steering feel attenuated between electric motors and computer algorithms; the torque of the strong twin-turbo dampened by the pliant, obedient, giving suspension.</p><p>It's everything you want, in a car you would never want it in.</p><p>It lacks drama, it lacks cinema. It lacks <span class="italic">trouble</span>.</p><br><p>"You don't like it?"</p><p>"Not exactly - I don't understand it." I paused. "Do you like it?"</p><p>"Yes, I do. But mostly because I thought that you do as well."</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>"You smile while driving."</p><br><p>Everywhere we went people felt the need to approach me about the car. Two separate men on two separate days said, "I want one as a daily driver." I overheard children saying they like the color as they looked at their reflections in the paint. In the morning, there were traces of a cat's paw prints on the hood, windshield, and carbon roof. I learned, too, that if your car is ugly-cute enough you can park on private property to take pictures of it and the owner of said property, a young and very beautiful and tall woman, will happily greet you, her dog, breathing heavily, will smell the tires while you two talk, and she might even ask to see the photos. "It's like a pug," she said smiling.</p><br><p class="no-indent"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/fDRyJ1G0/M2-KURO-2.jpg" alt=""></p><br><p>Everyone, cats and dogs included, kept telling me why they enjoyed looking at the car, why they wanted one. And in the same breath, I was struggling to enjoy what small time I had with mine.</p><p class="italic">Mine?</p><p>To complete my second full-day with the car, I pulled into the drive-thru of my favorite burger chain, seat excessively reclined, "Guest House" by Daughters, a haunted torturous anthem of despair and longing, playing a little too loud, received feet pics from a dime-in-an-airplane while ordering a three-by-three-animal-style with fries well-done, and peaceably drank a milkshake with my left hand while shifting and steering with the right questioning whether or not I enjoyed the new M2.</p><p>Along the short tenure, just three days, I found myself with possessive sentiment constantly, thinking to myself, "My M2 this," speaking aloud to others, "My M2 that." The timbre within and the choice of my words seemingly silenced within the stealth of the cockpit - my optimisms, my joys, stifled by dormant expectation,</p><p class="italic">You smile while driving.</p><p>Immediately, where I had hoped for too much, she, sitting in the passenger seat touching the steering wheel or gearshift only to hold my hand, understood the car. Her existence, all her life, had been weighed against the desire of others. The affection of men enbittered by entitlement to her body, her emotions. Her parent's anger, a mechanism of control and symptom of good, albeit misplaced, intent, sought for her a future she never wanted, wasn't a happiness she envisioned. An identity split between the stresses of wanting acceptance, but needing independence, coupled with a deep longing for someone to fight to understand; lost in the unknown of how to achieve any of this, her emotions became throttled, her happiness valved and out of her control; her power diminished, trampled beneath boots. An attempt to extinguish her flame.</p><br><p class="no-indent"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Y2p9NPjZ/M2-KURO-4.jpg" alt=""></p><br><p>As if she were sitting next to me, the Pacific Ocean and a fourteen hour time difference now separating us, I can hear her voice.</p><p>And she was right. I am smiling.</p><p>Her voice a symphony in my head like an exhaust pulsating through luxury surround sound. Within the cocoon of the calm and enduring cabin, I could easily enjoy the song of her silences. How lucky, how incredibly fortunate, am I to witness the strength of her power, never in reserve, but conveyed through translation - the relinquishing of her mighty torque an attempt to remain level, not because it's wanted, but because it's necessary.</p><br><p>"You knew I liked it the whole time. How?"</p><p>"Because I know you."</p><br><p>As the forest air, seasoned by the vast ocean, became salty, the road down the mountain mended and widened. After engaging the car's more violent tune, shoutier exhaust, and stiffer suspension, after simply accepting, it seemed to relax. Together we hunted each morsel of joy. With its ease of use, its friendly nature, left-foot-braking and heel-toe-rev-matching, sometimes with computer assistance, down the long and winding road was seamless, without worry. I allowed myself ample courage: accelerating harder out of turns, slowing later and later into each bank, revving the engine higher and higher and higher out of turns and through the straights and deeper into dire. I inserted my smiling laughter generously between the orchestra of exhaust, tire, road, dirt, wind, and fire of her voice.</p><p>Stopping the car at a turnout, overlooking a portion of the mountain and seated high enough still to see the horizon, I aimed my sight past the waves and clouds and distant skies, past the continental divide and across time-zones. My Loro Piana Cashmere Storm System sweatsuit wrinkled beneath the seatbelt, my Rick Owens tractor boots creased deeply from constant shifting, and the contents of my Louis Vuitton Takashi Murakami multicolor speedy strewn about the backseat floor. But, after six-plus hours of driving, the car didn't complain, my body didn't feel tired, and my mind, without coffee, felt fresh still. Not once in these three days was I ever intimidated by the car or did I dread the manual transmission even through the heavy traffic of Los Angeles International Airport on a Saturday night. Not once did I wish I was in another car. Maybe I wished to be on a plane and in the air, though not another BMW. But here, my happiness plain in the mountain sky, my appreciation and fondness for the M2 deepened.</p><p>I admired the car in the late afternoon sun, not because it's the fastest, most beautiful, most engaging car, but because, in spite of those things, it still inspires. You fall in love with it for everything it's not trying and doesn't have to be; it excels at the one thing that matters most: existing. In today's automotive world, where safe design is a hegemony beneath the hierarchy and blueprint construct for survival, where every four door sedan has the same shape and dimensions, where even the twenty-thousand-dollar Ford Mustang and a one-hundred-thousand BMW M8 have exact proportions, there exists a 2023 Zandvoort Blue G87 M2. Ugly, short, squished face, boxy. But when you parallel park it in the slums of Malibu, singing hymns of love for a beautiful asian woman across the galaxy, people love to look at it, talk about it, smile at it.</p><br><p>Big Sur loved my M2, my M2 loved Big Sur. Carmel-by-the-Sea's seventeen-mile-scenic-drive became thirty-four, then fifty-one. I got pizza in Monterey and ice cream at the edge of the water. I thought of her and felt her hand on my knuckles as I shifted gears, felt her lips at each red light, heard her smile as she excitedly sang her favorite songs, felt her tears in mine as they fell.</p><br><p class="no-indent"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Z4sR3Vms/M2-KURO-1.jpg" alt=""></p><br><p>"How was it?" my friend asked, receiving the keys.</p><p>"Honestly."</p><p>"Yes, honestly."</p><p>"It's everything you want in the car that it all deserves to be in. Fun, comfortable, compromised but not without good reason."</p><p>"Exactly," he said. "That's why I gave it to you for three days. You have to live with it, sleep in it, eat in it, to get it. That's what those other auto-journalists don't understand. One day isn't enough."</p><p>"One month isn't enough." I said. "It's not the new or rehashed or lesser E46 M3. In the best way possible, it's too refined. Besides, people seem to love it." I told him my stories, my experience, my perspective. I told him about how men wanted it, women smiled in its seats and windows, children admired their blue reflections, curious animals explored it with their senses. I told him I was in love with the car, fell deeper in love while in the car."</p><p>"But?"</p><p>"I don't want one for myself."</p><p>"That's right. You like a little trouble."</p><p>We smiled.</p><p>"Why do people talk to you about my car. People don't even talk to me about my car."</p><p>Completely serious, I asked him:</p><p>"If you've never received business-class-seat-thirst-traps from a dime at an altitude of forty-thousand-feet and a fourteen-hour-time-difference in the ultimate-modern-daily-driving-machine, have you ever truly witnessed the miracles of the universe?"</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></div></div></div><div id="day-two-story" style="display:none"><div><p><a href="" id="back-button">back.</a></p></div><div id="title-page"><div class="title"><p><span class="italic">『 血液 』</span></p><p class="written-by">day 2<span class="italic"></span></p></div></div><div id="story-content"><div class="story"><p class="no-indent italic">Topanga Canyon Road, the place I come to forget.</p><br><p class="no-indent"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/zN9PDRcs/M2-KETSUEKI-3.jpg" alt=""></p><br><p class="italic">My eyes traced a path along the road ahead and the little blue car held tightly to the line. The noise of the exhaust reverberated through the speakers and against the mountain wall piercing my senses and common sense. The threat and thread of disaster winding and unwinding as it weaved through the canyon, stitching together a tapestry of wind, road, and smiles large enough to cover life's many and incessant worries. Faster, smoother, louder around each blind turn and thus blurred between the thrill of the unknown and the knowing safety of modern design.</p><p class="italic">Mere meters from avalanche, of metal and dirt and dark, I left-foot-trail-braked while the car's computer withdrew power from the wheels.</p><p class="italic">If you have a death wish, make it in a different car on a different road. Birds singing, mountain mist receding against the mounting morn, you won't want the path to end. Not only that but dying in this car, an instrument of safety would- No. That doesn't flow. Dying in a car as safe as this- That's not it either. The index of safety so broad- The tight strap of safety akin to being bound by an experienced dominatrix-</p><p>"I'm sorry," she said.</p><p>I brought the car to a turnout, stopped, and, counting, we kissed.</p><p>"It's not your fault." Another counted kiss.</p><p>While I drove, she tracked her eyes toward the railings that kept cars from falling off the edge, into the abyss. She watched as my hands turned the wheel, she listened to the tires turning smoothly on the road below, and she looked at me as we passed unguarded bends. Within her downward gaze, submerged beneath hundreds of falling feet, of rocks, twisted metal, she felt peace there in what she couldn't see. Her hands touched mine while I steered and, in those momeents, in her I could feel the wresting of dark temptation. When she looked up, towards the nets preventing rocks from falling onto passing peoples, she untangled each bastion of safety. Her heavy clouds became boulders and would rain down.</p><p>There is a version of us, existing within her, that never left this road.</p><br><p class="no-indent"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/HdtStvkm/M2-KETSUEKI-2.jpg" alt=""></p><br><p>"May I say something." I looked to her. "I'm sorry."</p><p>"For."</p><p>"Interrupting your interal monologue car review." I laughed. "Topanga Canyon Road," her voice mockingly deepend, impersonating mine, "the place I always come when I want to forget." She's always like this. Understanding, intuitive; a sweetness that nurtures; the tale and toll of honeybees; the remuneration of flowers. "I know you. Do not keep your voice to yourself, share it with me.</p><p>"Always."</p><p>"Always."</p><p>I nodded. Her fingers wrapped around my wrist, tapped on my knuckles.</p><p>"You won't want the path to end - the beckoning horizon desperate with color. If you have a death wish, make it in a different car on a different road. In this car, here with me, life chooses you. Give too much throttle, let the car pull away. Advance too quickly into blind turns, gift yourself that curiosity, and let the car correct you. Not because you're unskilled, but because, more than anything, it wants to keep you safe. It wants to live with you at the raw selvedge edge, the meniscus of joy.</p><p>"Always.</p><p>"Here, safety is not in control, but instead about approaching what extremes are permitted and existing there for as long as possible. The consistent ability to live at the maximums of life, wouldn't you?</p><p>"Make the choice. Let yourself be led - led by the road, the setting sun, by her smile. Let to surface latent desire, immolate apprehension, allow yourself as much life in what small time we're given."</p><br><p>"May I say something. Remember what we said. Let's not make it sad."</p><p>"It is impossible to be sad over pizza. Especially with you."</p><p>"For later. Later tonight."</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"Yes. Remember the other day, when we rehearsed, how easy it was. We did very little and there was nothing easier."</p><p>"Long hugs and passionate kisses."</p><p>"Shake my hand, kiss my cheek quickly, leave."</p><p>"Walk away from me and don't look back."</p><p>"There is no reason to look back. Actually, don't kiss me."</p><p>"Yes, okay." I nodded, "It will be easy. But we can kiss right now." She leaned across the table. "May I ask something. What's the verdict."</p><p>She tapped a finger on her strong chin, rested the back of her hand on her stronger jaw.</p><p>"The best."</p><p>"Better than Kuro."</p><p>"Mm."</p><p>"Selma's. Folk's. Tony's."</p><p>Mm. Hmm - mm. Mm.</p><p>"It is so wonderful. The pizza, this sparkling water." I looked at her hands, her long fingers holding delicately a large slice. Her lips, her teeth, her smile.</p><p>"Don't do that. Don't say sweet things. Make your voice ugly."</p><p>"That is difficult."</p><p>"You must."</p><p>"You will carry your own luggage out of the trunk."</p><p>"The way you were driving, everything has probably become undone. You gave me many precious gifts. It will be hard."</p><p>"You packed the dry flowers. How."</p><p>"Carefully."</p><p>"I will give what i can give."</p><p>We spoke together: "I will take what I can take. I will endure what has to be endured."</p><p>"Her writing is so perfect. It is perfect because it is true." I said.</p><p>"Isn't it. How hundreds of pages of tension she dissolves so easily with a single sentence."</p><p>"It cannot be easy. To grow up with so much expectation. To have people dictate your words, your dress, your desires."</p><p>"It is not easy. It is very difficult."</p><p>"I have never known such things."</p><p>"Yes you have. Only it is easier for boys to rebel."</p><p>"You are very strong."</p><p>"That is why tonight will be easy for me. I will shake your hand, thank you in brief, and walk away smiling. Thank you, good-night, good-bye." She was determined. She got up from her seat and sat with me in mine. She held me close and, resting her head on my shoulder, I brushed her hair and kissed her temple. I felt her pulse; everything about her was strong.</p><p>"Knowing this is easy for you, knowing you will not be in pain, this makes me glad."</p><p>She continued to sit next to me as we finished our pizza. It felt as if there were a force holding her to me. In space when you attach two pieces of metal together, even without heat, they fuse. Similar to this. We sat in silence for a time, our fingers talking. Together we cosplayed a giant weight on a memory foam mattress, imprinting each other onto each other.</p><p>"If she were writing our story, how do you think she would end it?"</p><p>She thought to herself for a moment and did not answer. She got up from the table and, facing the door, extended her hand for me to take.</p><br><p class="no-indent"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9C28ZHV1/M2-KETSUEKI-1.jpg" alt=""></p><br><p>Over Mulholland Drive we watched the sunset. It was purple and gold. There too we rehearsed saying good-bye. She struggled with her luggage in the trunk and I idly watched. She gave me a look of contempt, pushed me away as I tried to rehearse hug her, and walked down the road. I waited a few minutes for her to return, then drove down the path to find her sobbing, dragging her silver suitcase. You didn't help me. I'm not supposed to. I know, I'm sorry. I got out of the car, opened her door, strapped and buckled her into safety, kissed her tears, and put her luggage in the trunk while wiping away my own. I sat down, half smiling, she asked for ice cream. I was crying because I do not want you to see me struggle so much. I want to remain always the image of a strong woman you have of me in your mind. Not Somebody weak, not somebody that cries over nothingness. Yes, I said, do not worry about such things. You know the truth of it. We said very much during those few hours. Often speaking over one another, rushing to say things of little value. Our cheeks and hands would tire, and she would ask me to shift with my left as I drove to keep me closer for longer. If I am holding your hand with my right, driving the car with my left, how will I eat ice cream. I will feed it to you. This made me happy.</p><br><p>"Can you finish this for me?"</p><p>"I will have it."</p><p>"I am going to miss the Los Angeles pizza." She said easily, glancing at me as she exited the car, setting the ice cream on her empty seat.</p><p>"The pizza will be here when you return."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>The international terminal driveway was hectic. Merging cars passed close to mine. I struggled to get out, to get the door open. Security agents huddled around other travelers, shouting with their loud voices, instructing them to quickly move on. I stood leaning against the rear fender, watched a plane in the night sky, watched other people hug and kiss and listened to their enthusiastic farewells, watched as she set down her luggage.</p><p>"My friends want to go to Japan in October. I will join them."</p><p>"Yes. October is not far away."</p><p>No distance is, I failed to say.</p><p>"May I say something."</p><p>She raised the handle and watched me closely as I closed the trunk. She stepped onto and brought the heavy bag over the curb and turned to me.</p><p>"Thank you. For this month. For listening to me, understanding me. Making me feel safe. Thank you for letting me cry. Thank you for all the pizza, thank you for letting me pay for most of them. Thank you for using your nice voice to say nice things."</p><p>"Of course. You deserve-"</p><p>"I'm not finished." She extended her palm. "And, even though we never said it out loud, thank you for loving me."</p><p>She shook my hand and left without letting me reply. She wheeled her big luggage away, not a single trace of sadness in her practiced motion. I wished she would come back, but we made a promise. I took a step forward, but we made a promise. I would have been mad at who I was in that moment, the person that spoke of living the fullest life in car reviews but let her so easily escape, but we made a promise. Instead, I half smiled, reached to finish her ice cream, and when I looked up she was gone. I'll finish it here, I thought to myself. I'll stay here until I cannot feel her then I will leave. Maybe I will stay until I am threatened. Yes. I won't move. What is there any good in movement. In all we agreed we wouldn't do, she said nothing about this.</p><p>Yet I hated myself for doing nothing, for standing here as promised, while she easily left as she promised.</p><p>A security guard shouted to me, motioning their hands. They looked at me, looked at her, and said: five minutes. No more.</p><p>We took twenty.</p><p>I found her shortly past the automatic doors, frozen, off to the side, looking at the floor. She let me hold her, she let me wrap my arms around her body, she let me kiss her. She let me press my forehead so hard to hers it hurt us both. I let her let me bring the luggage through check-in and lift it onto the scale. I wrote my name onto a tag and applied it to the handle of the bag. She admired the paper, removed it, and armed it on her wrist. She wrote on a tag of her own and put it on me. You are mine, her eyes said, wherever you go, through whomever's arms you pass, you are mine and I am yours. We kissed many times, counting none of them. She trembled as our hands separated. She did her best to contain her violence as she stood alone through security. She looked back very often, and I searched constantly to meet her gaze.</p><br><p class="no-indent italic">Topanga Canyon Road, the place I always come when I want to forget.</p><br><p class="no-indent"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/JmZYszwG/M2-KETSUEKI-4.jpg" alt=""></p><br><p class="italic">Through a haze of tears, through loud music, and through the poorly lit midnight mountainside path, the road felt much different. Surprisingly, the M2 is more enjoyable to drive in the near dark.</p><p class="italic">As the roads become more dangerous, the car's dependability tunes to match. When you're alone on the road, truly alone, it is then you finally can exist in tandem with the machine and, with its bright lights, expose all it has to give. But only if you let it, only if you ask, only if you say something, only if you take action. The more power you demand, the more it provides. Any ounce of fear in braking withdrawn, courage deposited in its place. This is where new cars shine, why I fell in love with it. The inherit ability to do everything all at once. The windows are down, exhaust and music loud, and-</p><p class="italic">I can't do this.</p><p>My eyes, drifting away from the road ahead, gravitated towards the railings that kept me from falling off the edge. Instinctively, my hands turned the wheel of the car, keeping me on the paved road as I stared with affection at each unguarded bend. My gaze, averted downwards, towards hundreds of feet of falling, of rocks and twisted metal, and I felt peace there in what I couldn't see. I look up toward the nets lining the mountain and saw only darkness, saw faint flickering lights in the black sky. There existed, in my mind, a version of us that never touched the ground.</p><p>Those heavy clouds above became saviors and rained her into me.</p><p>My phone rang.</p><p>I brought the car to a turnout and answered.</p><p>"Don't do it."</p><p>"I haven't thought to."</p><p>"I'm sorry," she said, "I broke my promises. I let you help me."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"And I interrupted your review again."</p><p>"To hear your voice: this is all I want."</p><p>"I am on the plane."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>A short silence.</p><p>"If I had another ticket-"</p><p>"-would you come with me?"</p><p>"Such a wonderful movie. Thank you." Her voice was very weak. "Would you?"</p><p>"I do not live in a world of what if. You know this."</p><p>"I know. I just needed to hear you say it."</p><p>She could hear the smile in my silence.</p><p>"May I ask you something?"</p><p>"Anything."</p><p>"Keep going, please. Until I am very high in the air. Until I am too far away to hear your voice. Until the call disconnects, please, don't leave me.
